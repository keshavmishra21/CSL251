Implementation of Booth's algorithm for integer multiplication in Python/C/C++/Java

Implement Booth's algorithm for integer multiplication in Python/C/C++/Java, satisfying the following conditions:

1. The designed program takes as inputs: an integer n, two binary integers of size n.
2. The binary integer inputs should be treated to be in 2's complement format.
3. To process the binary numbers, your program is ONLY allowed to use: negation, shift and addition operations.
